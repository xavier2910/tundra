# tundra

The engine library for a second take at [The Tundra](github.com/xavier2910/thetundra).
This repository has no game content. You can find the new game
[here](github.com/xavier2910/tundragame).

I no longer plan on working on this project; at it for 2.5 yrs, 4 iterations (2 on github cause they're the only ones with substantial content), now I'm done.

## Features

`tundra` contains a domain language for text adventure games, including structures for
the player, locations, and game objects, as well as a (simple) command processor.

You can find a more detailed feature list in the
[changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Getting Started

Nothing special about getting the package, just `go get github.com/xavier2910/tundra@VERSION`.
The [methodology document](METHODOLOGY.md) has more specific information about the
structure of the project.

There will be more examples and tutorials once I've actually built something with it.

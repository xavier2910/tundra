# tundra

A second take at [The Tundra](github.com/xavier2910/thetundra), with a
library for the game engine. Currently there is no game content, but
plenty of basic library functionality, which can be `go get`ed as per
usual (`go get github.com/xavier2910/tundra`).

You can find a more detailed feature list in the
[changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
